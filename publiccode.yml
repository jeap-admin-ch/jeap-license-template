    shortDescription: Third-party license list file template for the Maven License Plugin
    longDescription: >
      The third-party license list file template for the Maven License Plugin provides a clear record of project 
      dependencies and their licenses. It ensures transparency and simplifies compliance reviews.
      The file is written in Markdown for readability in both raw and rendered formats, making it easy to maintain and
      review in version control.
      Version numbers are intentionally omitted to avoid unnecessary changes during merges between snapshot and 
      non-snapshot branches. Exact versions remain available in the Maven POM file, keeping the list focused on licenses
      while preventing merge conflicts.
    features:
      - License template file for the maven-license-plugin, to be used in all open-source jEAP repos
